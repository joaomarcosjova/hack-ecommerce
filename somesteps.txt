Creating a vulnerable ecommerce website for a Capture The Flag (CTF) style challenge can be a great way to teach and practice cybersecurity skills. Here’s a list of 10 realistic vulnerabilities and corresponding flags that participants might discover and exploit. Each flag corresponds to a real scenario and represents a common type of vulnerability found in web applications.

### 1. **SQL Injection**
   - **Scenario**: The website's search functionality or login page might be vulnerable to SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries to access or alter database content.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{SQL_INJECTION_SUCCESS}`

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Scenario**: A form or comment section on the website allows users to input HTML or JavaScript, leading to XSS attacks where malicious scripts can be executed in other users' browsers.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{XSS_EXPERIMENTATION_COMPLETE}`

### 3. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
   - **Scenario**: A URL or request parameter exposes direct references to internal objects (like user profiles or orders), allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{IDOR_VULNERABILITY_FOUND}`

### 4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Scenario**: The website lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick a user into making unwanted actions on their behalf (e.g., changing account details).
   - **Flag**: `HKS{CSRF_PROTECTION_BYPASSED}`

### 5. **Command Injection**
   - **Scenario**: An input field or backend service allows users to inject and execute system commands on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{COMMAND_INJECTION_EXPLOIT}`

### 6. **Broken Authentication**
   - **Scenario**: The login system has weaknesses like weak password policies, predictable user IDs, or lack of proper session management, allowing unauthorized access to accounts.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{AUTH_BYPASS_SUCCEEDED}`

### 7. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Scenario**: The website inadvertently exposes sensitive information, such as database backups, configuration files, or personal data, either through improper access controls or insecure storage.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{DATA_EXPOSURE_DISCOVERED}`

### 8. **File Upload Vulnerability**
   - **Scenario**: An upload feature allows users to upload files without proper validation, leading to the possibility of uploading malicious files that could be executed on the server.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{UNSAFE_FILE_UPLOAD_FOUND}`

### 9. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - **Scenario**: The website allows users to make requests to internal services or other servers, which can be exploited to access internal network services or metadata.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{SSRF_SUCCESSFULLY_EXPLOITED}`

### 10. **Directory Traversal**
   - **Scenario**: The website’s file handling mechanisms allow users to navigate directories and access files outside the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive files.
   - **Flag**: `HKS{DIRECTORY_TRAVERSAL_COMPLETE}`

### Implementation Tips

1. **Create Vulnerable Scenarios**: Develop these vulnerabilities within your website using various components, such as login forms, file upload interfaces, and data handling functions.
2. **Craft Realistic Flags**: Place the flags in locations or scenarios that make sense for each vulnerability. For example, the flag for SQL Injection could be hidden in a database entry.
3. **Documentation and Instructions**: Provide a README or documentation outlining how participants can engage with each vulnerability and what to look for.
4. **Security Measures**: Ensure that these vulnerabilities are present only in the intended environments (e.g., staging or educational versions) and not in any production or live versions.

These flags will not only help participants practice their skills but also provide a comprehensive learning experience by exposing them to common web vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
